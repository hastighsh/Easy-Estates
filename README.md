## Purpose

>The purpose of this application is to help find the most affordable region within Canada to buy a home.<br>
To make the search for an estate, easy~

## How it works?
>The data used was provided by Statistics Canada (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start) that covers the time period between December 1981 and December 2022, of all provinces and major cities. This data uses the monthly New housing price index (NHPI) using December 2016 as the reference. This index tells us if the price for a new house is higher or lower than the reference.
